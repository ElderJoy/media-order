# media-order
Ordering media files in local storage.
This project aimed to:
 - scan for media files (video, audio, in future probably other types of files),
 - discover them by parsing names and metadata,
 - try to identify by public media database like imdb (possibly use downloaded imdb data)
 - create database of mediafiles in storage
 - provide information from media db
 - organise media collection by renaming in structured way, adding mediadata to files, looking for duplicates

Currently in the very early development stage. Just video file mane parsing implemented.
